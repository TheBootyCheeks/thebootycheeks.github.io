Small swgoh website that compares the csv files to provide guild users with relevant data to track monthly progress.

The index.html is built to pull data from the new .csv (Chewbooty.csv) and compare it with the prior month's .csv (ChewbootyOld.csv). Increases/decreases in relevant data is represented by positive or negative numbers (green/red) in the spreadsheet.

Steps to install:

1) clone
2) every month delete *Old.csv file
3) rename the other .csv file to *Old.csv.
4) Upload new *.csv
5) Rinse and repeat each month to see monthly stat changes in the guild

This is meant to work solely with the .csv that can be downloaded from the Hotutils guild section.
